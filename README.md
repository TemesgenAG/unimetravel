Home Page: Features a slider showcasing countries with available tours.
About Page: Provides detailed information about each country, including images of cities and towns, as well as weekly offers for each city.
Reservation Page: Users can make their own reservations.
Deals Page: Allows users to search and view various tour deals.
Login and Register Pages: For user account management.
Upcoming Features: We plan to add a user dashboard to check reservation statuses and more.
